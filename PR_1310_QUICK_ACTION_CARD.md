## ‚úÖ FIX #1: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Line ~59-74: Replace entire conflicted section with:**

```yaml
  step-enum-sorted:
    name: Step enum sorted
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 10
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v5.0.0
        with:
          persist-credentials: false
          fetch-depth: 1

      - name: Check if `Step` enum is sorted
        run: |
          ENUM_NAME="Step"
          FILE="src/step.rs"
          awk "/enum $ENUM_NAME/,/}/" "$FILE" | \
          grep -E '^\s*[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*\s*,?$' | \
          sed 's/[, ]//g' > original.txt
          sort original.txt > sorted.txt
          diff original.txt sorted.txt

  step-match-sorted:
    name: Step match sorted
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 10
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v5.0.0
        with:
          persist-credentials: false
          fetch-depth: 1

      - name: Check if `Step::run()`'s match is sorted
        run: |
          FILE="src/step.rs"
          awk '/[[:alpha:]] =>/{print $1}' $FILE > original.txt
          sort original.txt > sorted.txt
          diff original.txt sorted.txt

  main:
    needs: [ fmt, step-enum-sorted, step-match-sorted ]
```

**Key changes:**

- Keep the PR's job structure (separate jobs)
- Remove old complex bash script
- Update needs: from `custom-checks` to both new jobs

---

## ‚úÖ FIX #2: `.github/workflows/create_release_assets.yml`

**Similar pattern:** Keep PR version + security additions

- All `timeout-minutes` specifications
- All `persist-credentials: false`
- All `fetch-depth: 1`

Follow same pattern as ci.yml.

---

## üì§ PUSH CHANGES

```powershell
# After both files are fixed:
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml
git add .github/workflows/create_release_assets.yml

git commit -m "Merge main: resolve workflow conflicts"

git push -f origin pr-1310
```

---

## üîç THEN INVESTIGATE (15-30 mins)

```powershell
# Look at large deletions
git diff main..pr-1310 -- src/sudo.rs | head -50
git diff main..pr-1310 -- src/main.rs
git diff main..pr-1310 -- locales/app.yml
```

**Questions:**

- Are these deletions intentional?
- Do they relate to security changes?
- Should they be in a separate PR?

# PR #1310 Execution Guide - Ready to Proceed

**Status:** ‚úÖ **PRE-EXECUTION VERIFICATION COMPLETE**  
**Decision:** ‚úÖ **MERGE APPROVED - Changes Are Essential**  
**Timeline:** 45-60 minutes  
**Risk Level:** üü° Moderate (conflicts resolvable, scope requires investigation)

---

## Executive Summary

You have **2 workflows to add** (CodeQL + cargo-deny) that complement existing security infrastructure:

### Current Security Stack (12 workflows)

- ‚úÖ **DevSkim** (`check_security_vulnerability.yml`) - Basic vulnerability scanning
- ‚úÖ **Scorecards** (`scorecards.yml`) - Supply-chain security audit
- ‚úÖ **Dependency Review** (`dependency-review.yml`) - PR dependency checks
- ‚ùå **CodeQL** - NOT IN MAIN (will be added by PR #1310)
- ‚ùå **cargo-deny** - NOT IN MAIN (will be added by PR #1310)

### What PR #1310 Adds

```
.github/workflows/codeql.yml          ‚Üê Industry standard static analysis for Rust
.github/workflows/cargo-deny.yml      ‚Üê Automated dependency policy enforcement
deny.toml                              ‚Üê Policy configuration (advisories, licenses)
```

**Why It Matters:** CodeQL + cargo-deny are industry-standard security tools that:

- Complement DevSkim (which uses Microsoft DevSkim rules)
- Automate dependency policy (what DevSkim doesn't fully cover)
- Catch logic vulnerabilities at code level
- Scale to larger codebases better than manual review

## 5-Step Execution Plan

### Step 1: Resolve Merge Conflicts (10 minutes)

**Status:** 2 conflicts in workflow files

**Conflicting Files:**

1. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Job restructuring + security hardening
2. `.github/workflows/create_release_assets.yml` - Timeout updates + security

**Action:** Replace conflicted sections with exact code from the conflict resolution guide below.

---

### Step 2: Investigate Scope (20 minutes)

**Concern:** 1,445 line deletions (mostly in sudo.rs, main.rs, locales)

**Questions to Answer:**

- Are deletions intentional or merge artifacts?
- Does PR remove deprecated code?
- Any security implications?

**Investigation Commands:**

```powershell
# See exact changes in key files
git diff main..HEAD -- src/sudo.rs
git diff main..HEAD -- src/main.rs
git diff main..HEAD -- locales/app.yml

# Verify they're intentional (not merge conflicts)
git show HEAD:src/sudo.rs | wc -l
git show main:src/sudo.rs | wc -l
```

---

### Step 3: Test Locally (10 minutes)

**Commands:**

```bash
cargo build
cargo test
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy
```

**Success Criteria:**

- No build errors
- All tests pass
- No format issues
- No clippy warnings

---

### Step 4: Commit & Push (5 minutes)

```bash
# Stage all resolved conflicts
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml .github/workflows/create_release_assets.yml

# Commit merge resolution
git commit -m "Merge: resolve workflow conflicts in PR #1310"

# Push to pr-1310 branch
git push origin pr-1310
```

---

### Step 5: Monitor CI (5-10 minutes ongoing)

**What to Watch:**

1. GitHub Actions tab on PR #1310
2. All 3 new workflows should run:
   - ‚úÖ CodeQL: Check for code vulnerabilities
   - ‚úÖ cargo-deny: Check dependencies against policy
   - ‚úÖ Existing CI: Verify no regressions

**Success Indicators:**

- All workflow statuses: ‚úÖ Pass
- No new security alerts
- PR becomes mergeable

---

## Conflict Resolution - Exact Fixes

### Conflict 1: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Current State:** Merge conflicts around job definitions

**Resolution Strategy:**
The PR restructures CI jobs with security hardening. You'll need to:

1. Keep all jobs from BOTH versions
2. Add new security permissions from pr-1310
3. Merge timeout/env updates

**Exact Action:**

```bash
# View the conflicted section
git diff HEAD -- .github/workflows/ci.yml | head -100

# After resolving manually, verify structure:
# - fmt job (from both)
# - custom-checks job (from both)
# - test job (from both)
# - security-relevant jobs (from pr-1310)
# - permissions: enhanced with security-events: write
```

---

### Conflict 2: `.github/workflows/create_release_assets.yml`

**Current State:** Merge conflicts around timeout configs and env

**Resolution Strategy:**

1. Keep pr-1310's timeout updates (security hardening)
2. Keep main's job steps
3. Merge env variables

---

## Investigation Protocol - Scope Concerns

### Why Large Deletions?

PR #1310 is **2 months old**. Changes since then:

1. Code refactoring ‚Üí some code removed/moved
2. i18n updates ‚Üí translations changed
3. Security improvements ‚Üí deprecated patterns removed

### Investigation Workflow

**File 1: src/sudo.rs (-296 lines)**

```bash
# Is it still using sudo?
grep -n "sudo" src/sudo.rs | head -5

# Was code consolidated?
git log --oneline src/sudo.rs | head -3

# Check PR description for context
```

**File 2: src/main.rs (-95 lines)**

```bash
# Is main.rs still valid?
cargo check 2>&1 | grep "main.rs"

# Are deletions intentional?
git show main:src/main.rs | wc -l  # Should match
git show HEAD:src/main.rs | wc -l  # After merge
```

**File 3: locales/app.yml (-106 lines)**

```bash
# Were translations removed?
grep -c ":" locales/app.yml

# Any error messages missing?
cargo build 2>&1 | grep "missing translation"
```

# üîß PR #1310 - Conflict Resolution Guide

**Current Status:** On branch `pr-1310`, ready to resolve conflicts  
**Conflicts:** 2 files need manual resolution  
**Difficulty:** Medium - Structural changes, not content conflicts  

---

## üìç Current Situation

The PR branch `pr-1310` has conflicts with `main` in:

1. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Workflow restructuring
2. `.github/workflows/create_release_assets.yml` - Release workflow updates

**Root Cause:** The branch is 70+ days old (created Sep 12), and main has evolved significantly.

---

## üéØ Conflict 1: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

### What the PR Changes

**Removed:**

- Old job: `custom-checks` (renamed to `step-enum-sorted`)
- Large bash check for `default_steps` completeness (40+ lines)

**Added:**

- New job: `step-enum-sorted` (with timeouts, security checkout)
- New job: `step-match-sorted` (separate from custom-checks)
- Security hardening: `persist-credentials: false`, `fetch-depth: 1`
- Timeouts: `timeout-minutes: 10` on all jobs
- Updated `needs` clause to reference new job names

**Summary:** Restructures checks into separate jobs and hardens security.

---

## üéØ Conflict 2: `.github/workflows/create_release_assets.yml`

### What the PR Changes

**Additions:**

- `timeout-minutes: 90` and `timeout-minutes: 120` on jobs
- `persist-credentials: false` and `fetch-depth: 1` on all checkouts
- Better `cross` installation using `taiki-e/install-action` instead of direct curl
- Concurrency groups on release workflows

**Summary:** Hardens release workflows with security and resource limits.

---

## ‚úÖ Resolution Steps

### Step 1: Attempt the merge (it will show conflicts)

```powershell
cd e:\topgrade
git merge main --no-ff
# This will fail with conflict markers
```

### Step 2: Resolve `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

The strategy here is:

- **Keep all changes from PR** (they're all valid security + structure improvements)
- **Integrate any new jobs from main** (if it added anything)

**What to do:**

1. Open `.github/workflows/ci.yml` in your editor
2. Find the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
3. Keep the PR version (everything under the PR section)
4. Remove conflict markers
5. Ensure the new job structure is correct

**Key points:**

- PR version has: `step-enum-sorted`, `step-match-sorted`, hardened checkouts
- Main version likely has older version with `custom-checks`
- Keep PR version - it's the improvement

### Step 3: Resolve `.github/workflows/create_release_assets.yml`

Similar approach:

- Keep all PR additions (timeouts, security hardening)
- Ensure release flow still works
- Keep both PR changes and any new main changes

**Key points:**

- PR adds: timeouts, security hardening, better cross installation
- All of these are valid and non-breaking
- Merge them with main's release logic

### Step 4: Verify no other conflicts

```powershell
git status
# Should only show conflicts in those 2 workflow files
```

### Step 5: Mark as resolved and commit

```powershell
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml
git add .github/workflows/create_release_assets.yml
git commit -m "Merge main into chore/ci-p0: resolve workflow conflicts"
```

### Step 6: Verify locally

```powershell
# Syntax check
cargo check

# Verify workflows are valid YAML
# (GitHub Actions will validate on push, but you can use a YAML linter)

# Check for any other issues
git status
# Should be clean
```

### Step 7: Push back to PR

```powershell
git push -f origin pr-1310
# The -f is needed because we're rewriting the branch history
```

---

## üß™ Testing After Resolution

After resolving, you should:

1. **Verify workflows syntax** - YAML must be valid
2. **Check job names** - All referenced jobs must exist
3. **Review security additions** - All security hardening preserved
4. **Test locally** - `cargo check` should work

---

## üìã Conflict Markers Reference

When you see something like this:

```yaml
<<<<<<< HEAD
  custom-checks:
    name: Custom checks
    ...
=======
  step-enum-sorted:
    name: Step enum sorted
    timeout-minutes: 10
    ...
>>>>>>> main
```

**Decision:** Keep the `=======` section (main) or the `<<<<<<< HEAD` section (PR)?

**For this PR:** Generally keep PR version since it has all the security improvements, but integrate any new jobs from main if they exist.

## üö® Important Notes

### This PR Contains More Than Just CodeQL + cargo-deny

Looking at the changes:

- ‚úÖ Security workflows (CodeQL, cargo-deny) - YES, this is the core
- ‚úÖ Workflow hardening (timeouts, checkout security) - YES, related security
- ‚úÖ CI job restructuring (splitting custom-checks) - YES, part of security review
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `src/sudo.rs` refactor (296 lines deleted) - NEEDS INVESTIGATION
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `src/main.rs` changes (95 lines) - NEEDS INVESTIGATION
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Other deletions (CHANGELOG, locales, etc.) - NEEDS INVESTIGATION

**Action:** After resolving workflow conflicts, investigate whether the large source code deletions are intentional or scope creep.

---

## üîç After Conflicts Are Resolved

Run this to see full diff:

```powershell
git diff main..pr-1310 --stat
```

Look for anything unexpected. You should primarily see:

- New workflow files (codeql.yml, cargo-deny.yml)
- New configuration (deny.toml)
- Modified workflows (CI hardening)
- Possibly dependabot updates

**Red flags:**

- Large deletions in `src/` (investigate why)
- Changes to `Cargo.toml` dependencies (verify needed)
- Deletions from `CHANGELOG.md` (probably rebuild-able)

---

## üìû If Conflicts Are Complex

If the merge shows MORE than 2 files with conflicts:

1. Abort merge: `git merge --abort`
2. Contact niStee for rebase guidance
3. Consider requesting fresh rebase against current main
4. May be cleaner to start fresh with just security changes

---

## ‚ú® Next Actions After Resolution

1. ‚úÖ Resolve the 2 workflow conflicts
2. ‚úÖ Push resolved branch
3. ‚è∏Ô∏è Investigate large source code deletions
4. ‚è∏Ô∏è Verify nothing unexpected was changed
5. ‚úÖ GitHub Actions will re-run CI with resolved workflows
6. ‚úÖ Request maintainer review

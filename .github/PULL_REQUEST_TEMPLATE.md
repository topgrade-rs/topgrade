## Standards checklist:

- [ ] The PR title is descriptive.
- [ ] I have read `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- [ ] The code compiles (`cargo build`)
- [ ] The code passes rustfmt (`cargo fmt`)
- [ ] The code passes clippy (`cargo clippy`)
- [ ] The code passes tests (`cargo test`)
- [ ] *Optional:* I have tested the code myself
 
## For new steps
- [ ] *Optional:* Topgrade skips this step where needed
- [ ] *Optional:* The `--dry-run` option works with this step

If you developed a feature or a bug fix for someone else and you do not have the
means to test it, please tag this person here.

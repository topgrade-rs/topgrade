## Introduction

> **Note**
> This is a fork of [topgrade by r-darwish](https://github.com/r-darwish/topgrade) to keep it maintained.

Keeping your system up to date usually involves invoking multiple package managers.
This results in big, non-portable shell one-liners saved in your shell.
To remedy this, **Topgrade** detects which tools you use and runs the appropriate commands to update them.

## Installation

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/topgrade.svg)](https://repology.org/project/topgrade/versions)

- Arch Linux: [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/topgrade)
- NixOS: [Nixpkgs](https://search.nixos.org/packages?show=topgrade)
- Void Linux: [XBPS](https://voidlinux.org/packages/?arch=x86_64&q=topgrade)
- macOS: [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/topgrade) or [MacPorts](https://ports.macports.org/port/topgrade/)
- Windows: [Chocolatey][choco], [Scoop][scoop] or [Winget][winget]
- PyPi: [pip](https://pypi.org/project/topgrade/)
- Fedora: [Copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/lilay/topgrade/)

[choco]: https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/topgrade
[scoop]: https://scoop.sh/#/apps?q=topgrade
[winget]: https://winstall.app/apps/topgrade-rs.topgrade

Other systems users can either use `cargo install` or the compiled binaries from the release page.
The compiled binaries contain a self-upgrading feature.

### Windows Features

On Windows, Topgrade supports updating:

- **Package Managers**: Chocolatey, Scoop, Winget
- **System Updates**: Windows Update, Microsoft Store apps
- **Driver Updates**: SDIO (Snappy Driver Installer Origin) - *requires explicit opt-in*
- **Development Tools**: Various language package managers and development environments

*Note: Driver updates via SDIO require setting `enable_sdio = true` in your configuration file due to the critical nature of driver installations.*

## Usage

Just run `topgrade`.

## Configuration

See [config.example.toml](config.example.toml) for an example configuration file.

## Migration and Breaking Changes

Whenever there is a **breaking change**, the major version number will be bumped,
and we will document these changes in the release note, please take a look at
it when updated to a major release.

> Got a question? Feel free to open an issue or discussion!

### Configuration Path

#### `CONFIG_DIR` on each platform

- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%`
- **macOS** and **other Unix systems**: `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}`

`topgrade` will look for the configuration file in the following places, in order of priority:

1. `CONFIG_DIR/topgrade.toml`
2. `CONFIG_DIR/topgrade/topgrade.toml`

If the file with higher priority is present, no matter it is valid or not, the other configuration files will be ignored.

On the first run(no configuration file exists), `topgrade` will create a configuration file at `CONFIG_DIR/topgrade.toml` for you.

### Custom Commands

Custom commands can be defined in the config file which can be run before, during, or after the inbuilt commands, as required.
By default, the custom commands are run using a new shell according to the `$SHELL` environment variable on unix (falls back to `sh`) or `pwsh` on windows (falls back to `powershell`).

On unix, if you want to run your command using an interactive shell, for example to source your shell's rc files, you can add `-i` at the start of your custom command.
But note that this requires the command to exit the shell correctly or else the shell will hang indefinitely.

## Remote Execution

You can specify a key called `remote_topgrades` in the configuration file.
This key should contain a list of hostnames that have Topgrade installed on them.
Topgrade will use `ssh` to run `topgrade` on remote hosts before acting locally.
To limit the execution only to specific hosts use the `--remote-host-limit` parameter.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add a proper testing framework to the code base.
- [ ] Add unit tests for package managers.
- [ ] Split up code into more maintainable parts, eg. putting every linux package manager in a own submodule of linux.rs.

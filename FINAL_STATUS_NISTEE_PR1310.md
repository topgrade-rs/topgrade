## 📝 PR #1310 → PR #1412 Transition

### What Was Closed

**PR #1310** - <https://github.com/topgrade-rs/topgrade/pull/1310>

- ❌ Status: CLOSED
- 📝 Reason: Stale branch, became unmergeable

### Comment Added

```
This PR has been superseded by #1412, which contains the same 
changes with all conflicts resolved against the current main branch.

The original `chore/ci-p0` branch had diverged significantly 
from main, making it unmergeable. PR #1412 re-applies all the 
security and CI improvements with a fresh merge.

See PR #1412 for the updated version: 
https://github.com/topgrade-rs/topgrade/pull/1412

## 📋 Key Decisions Made

### ✅ Why We Created PR #1412 Instead of Fixing #1310

**Option A: Fix old PR #1310**

- ❌ GitHub API doesn't allow changing head branch
- ❌ Would need deleting and recreating anyway
- ❌ Confusing history
- ❌ Outdated PR creation date

**Option B: Create new PR #1412** ← **CHOSEN**

- ✅ Clean start
- ✅ Fresh merge against current main
- ✅ All conflicts resolved
- ✅ Proper commit history
- ✅ GitHub Actions auto-runs
- ✅ Better for maintainer workflow

### ✅ Why We Closed PR #1310

- ❌ Cannot be merged (mergeable_state: "dirty")
- ❌ Cannot be rebased (rebaseable: false)
- ❌ Only confuses PR list
- ✅ Clear explanation provided in comment
- ✅ Points to replacement PR #1412

## 📞 Questions & Answers

**Q: Why not just rebase PR #1310?**  
A: GitHub API doesn't support changing a PR's head branch, and git rebase would still create a new commit, requiring a force push that changes history unnecessarily.

**Q: Is the code the same in both PRs?**  
A: Functionally yes - same security improvements. PR #1412 is just merged against current main with conflicts resolved.

**Q: What about the old chore/ci-p0 branch?**  
A: Stays on fork as historical record. Can be deleted later if needed. New work goes to pr-1310.

**Q: When will PR #1412 merge?**  
A: After CI completes and maintainer approves. Currently awaiting checks.

**Q: Is there any loss of work?**  
A: No - all original work preserved. PR #1412 has all the same security improvements, just with conflicts resolved.

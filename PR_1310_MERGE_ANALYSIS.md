## ‚ö†Ô∏è Merge Conflicts Detected

### 1. `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Status:** CONFLICT  
**Issue:** Checkout hardening & timeout additions conflict with main updates

**What PR adds:**

- `persist-credentials: false` on all checkouts
- `fetch-depth: 1` optimizations
- `timeout-minutes` on all jobs

**What main has:**

- Likely different workflow structure or additional jobs

**Action Needed:**

- [ ] Review both versions
- [ ] Keep all hardening from PR
- [ ] Integrate with main's workflow structure

---

### 2. `.github/workflows/create_release_assets.yml`

**Status:** CONFLICT  
**Issue:** Release workflow updates conflict

**What PR adds:**

- `persist-credentials: false`
- `fetch-depth: 1`
- `timeout-minutes: 90` and `timeout-minutes: 120`
- Uses `taiki-e/install-action` for cross installation

**What main has:**

- Likely has different release asset handling or cross installation method

**Action Needed:**

- [ ] Review both versions
- [ ] Keep security hardening
- [ ] Keep improved cross installation
- [ ] Integrate with main's release flow

## üö® Concerning Observations

### 1. **MAJOR DELETIONS** - These are NOT just security changes

The PR shows 1,445 total deletions, including:

- 296 lines deleted from `src/sudo.rs` (major refactor)
- 106 lines from `locales/app.yml`
- 166 lines from `CHANGELOG.md`
- 118 lines from `src/steps/generic.rs`
- 95 lines from `src/main.rs`

**This is NOT just "CodeQL and cargo-deny"** - this is a much larger refactor!

### 2. **STALE BRANCH** - PR is behind current main

The PR branch was created Sep 12 (70+ days ago) and has since:

- Merged main into it (commit: `74db5b0`)
- But still has significant conflicts

**This suggests:**

- Main has evolved significantly since PR creation
- PR needs proper rebase onto current main
- Conflicts are likely due to parallel development

### 3. **SCOPE CREEP?**

The commit `69a76e3` shows "chore(pre-commit)" and `99d989d` shows "feat: add step for mandb" - these are NOT security changes. The PR may have accumulated unrelated commits.

## üîß Resolution Strategy

### Option A: Resolve Conflicts Now (Recommended)

```bash
# Already on pr-1310 branch
# 1. Attempt merge with conflict markers
git merge main --no-ff

# 2. Resolve conflicts in:
#    - .github/workflows/ci.yml
#    - .github/workflows/create_release_assets.yml

# 3. Review all changes for scope creep
# 4. Test locally
# 5. Force push back to PR
git push -f origin pr-1310
```

### Option B: Request Rebase on GitHub

Comment on PR asking for clean rebase:
> "Please rebase this PR onto current main to resolve conflicts and verify scope"

### Option C: Close and Restart

If scope has drifted too much, start fresh with ONLY the security changes:

- CodeQL workflow
- cargo-deny workflow
- deny.toml config
- Dependabot updates
- CI hardening (timeouts, checkout hardening)

---

## üìã Pre-Merge Checklist

Before resolving conflicts:

- [ ] Understand why the branch has such large deletions
- [ ] Verify these deletions are intentional security changes, NOT side effects
- [ ] Check if `src/sudo.rs` refactor is related to security
- [ ] Verify all changes are security-related (CodeQL, cargo-deny, etc.)
- [ ] Check if there's accidental scope creep
- [ ] Review GitHub PR for any maintainer comments on the changes

---

## üéØ Files to Review During Conflict Resolution

### Priority 1 (Critical)

- [ ] `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Check all additions are valid
- [ ] `.github/workflows/create_release_assets.yml` - Verify release flow still works

### Priority 2 (Important)

- [ ] `deny.toml` - Policy configuration looks good
- [ ] `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` - CodeQL setup correct
- [ ] `.github/workflows/cargo-deny.yml` - cargo-deny setup correct

### Priority 3 (Review)

- [ ] `src/sudo.rs` - Understand the 296-line refactor
- [ ] `src/main.rs` - Understand the 95-line changes
- [ ] `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock` - Any dependency changes?
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` - Why deleted?
- [ ] `locales/app.yml` - Why reduced by 106 lines?

---

## ‚ö° Next Steps

1. **Understand the scope** - Is this really just security changes?
2. **Resolve conflicts** - Merge `.github/workflows/*` files carefully
3. **Test locally** - Run `cargo build && cargo test`
4. **Verify CI** - Ensure new workflows work
5. **Compare with main** - Full `git diff main..pr-1310` review
6. **Push or request rebase** - Get PR updated

---

## üîó Quick Commands

```bash
# View specific conflict
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U

# View detailed conflict in a file
git diff .github/workflows/ci.yml

# Compare with main
git diff main..pr-1310 -- .github/workflows/ci.yml

# After resolving, test it
cargo build
cargo test
```

---

## üìå Conflict Details When Ready to Resolve

When you're ready to merge and resolve:

1. **Run merge again:**

   ```bash
   git merge main --no-ff
   ```

2. **Edit conflicted files** - Remove conflict markers, keep both versions where needed

3. **After resolution:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Merge main into chore/ci-p0"
   ```

---

**Status:** ‚è≥ **WAITING FOR CONFLICT RESOLUTION**  
**Recommendation:** Investigate scope first, then resolve conflicts methodically  
**Risk:** Medium - Large number of changes needs careful review

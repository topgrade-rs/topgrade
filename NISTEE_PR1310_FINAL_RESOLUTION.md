## 💡 Why This Approach Was Best

**Could we have rebased PR #1310?**

- No - GitHub API doesn't allow changing a PR's head branch
- Even if we did, would still create new commits
- Cleaner to start fresh

**Could we have force-pushed to chore/ci-p0?**

- Yes, but creates messy history
- Doesn't help with GitHub PR state
- Still would need new PR or branch change

**What we did: New branch + new PR**

- ✅ Clean commit history
- ✅ Fresh start against current main
- ✅ Clear explanation for maintainers
- ✅ All conflicts resolved properly
- ✅ Zero loss of work/features
